# GRFM(Get-Ready-For-Maya)
Program created for my Forgetful and sometimes unorganized girlfriend that creates lists depending on current weather and event information, using OOP concepts.

Each event is an object with a vector containing items calculed from an unorderd map of enums dependendent on three factors, trip length, weather temp, trip type.
